LAMP RFLP Analysis
==================

This program was created for the analysis of restriction digests of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction. As the products of a LAMP reaction are loop structures which can get sucessively larger as the reaction proceeds, using a restriction digest to confirm the products by banding pattern is not as straight-forward as it is with a reaction like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This program allows for fast analysis by determining the expected banding pattern and outputting it to a virtual gel so that it may be compared to results obtained in a lab setting
